***** A Common Lisp Implementation of the Delta Blue algorithm *****

delta-blue.lisp implements the Delta Blue incremental constraint
satisfaction system using a constraint hierarchy with a
local-predicate-better comparator.  This code was translated directly from
the pseudocode in the appendix to UW CS TR 91-08-12 ``Using Constraints for
User Interface Construction'' by John Maloney, using similar function and
variable names.  Refer to the pseudocode for detailed comments.  This file
contains comments where the code is changed significantly from the
pseudocode.

examples.lisp contains a few functions for constructing simple constraints,
and some test programs.
